# Common Classes

Contains common classes which are used throughout SIRIUS.

One of the most commonly used classes would be the [Strings](Strings.java) helper.
Additionally the [Value](Value.java) class takes care of transforming input values
into desired datatypes.

Furthermore the [Amount](Amount.java) class provides an abstraction above **BigDecimal**
to simplify its usage.
