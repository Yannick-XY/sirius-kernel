# Contributions

Contributions as issues or pull requests are always welcome. 
Please [sign-off](http://developercertificate.org) 
all your commits by adding a line like "Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at 
the end of each commit, indicating that you wrote the code and have the
right to pass it on as an open source

When contributing source code, please ensure that maven ran at least once
so that your IntelliJ settings are properly update by the build script.
Nobody likes to resolve code-formatting conflicts.
