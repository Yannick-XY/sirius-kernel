```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.scireum</groupId>
    <artifactId>sirius-MODULE</artifactId>
    <version>PICK A VERSION</version>

```
An overview of all versions can be found on

When writing server software 
(using https://github.com/scireum/sirius-web or https://github.com/scireum/sirius-biz)
